# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes using machine learning models. It utilizes various classification algorithms to analyze patient data and make accurate predictions based on key health indicators.

## Features
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and feature scaling
- Implementation of multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - XGBoost
- Model evaluation and performance comparison
- User-friendly interface for prediction (if applicable)

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which includes several health parameters such as:
- Number of Pregnancies
- Glucose Level
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin Level
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn
  ```

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. If a web or GUI-based interface is included, follow the instructions in the respective folder.

## Model Evaluation
Each model is evaluated based on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC Curve

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with a web or mobile interface for easy accessibility
- Deployment as an API using Flask or FastAPI
- Experimenting with deep learning models for improved accuracy
